\subsection{Assessment}
Because of the design decision to only spawn update-threads when needed, and
kill them when not need any longer, I find my solution to be very efficient in
its used of threads --- no thread alive is obsolete. A simpler solution would
have an update thread for each cell kept alive, even though it has nothing but
a singular value to return. My solution only keeps an update-thread alive if
its associated cell is a formula --- requiring it to stay informed of changes.

As a result of this design decision long-running formulae cannot block, any
cell --- not even itself. It allows formulae to be in the process of
evaluation, but be stopped by issuing a \code{set\_value} message to the cell,
and this will simply discard the current update-thread, producing a new thread
that will be associated with the cell in question, thus avoiding deadlocks as
well.
