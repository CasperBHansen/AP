\subsection{Reflections}
The provided solution does not handle circular dependencies, and that is a
clear error in the solution. This is, however, only because I had to divert my
attention to other parts of the exam. Had I had more time I would have either
used the extra information field to accumulate which cells have are dependent
on the current evaluation, and if the cell being evaluated at that time is a
member of that set then a circular reference would have been detected, causing
an error.
