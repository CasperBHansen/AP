\subsection{Assessment}
I find the solution to be quite good, in spite of the incompleteness. The code
that was implemented does work, but cannot be tested against an actual
program. It's too bad that I was out of time, as I found the overall design of
the interpreter to be very well-thought out and I was so close to connecting
the last pieces of the implementation. I do recognize however, that since it
does not produce any observable results other than a debugging message in the
output, where execution stalls because of lacking implementation, it is not in
working order as an interpreter --- yet, but it's close.
