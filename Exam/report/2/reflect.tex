\subsection{Reflections}
Although the interpreter is incomplete, and does not yield any meaningful
output for testing, I believe I have a firm understanding of how to complete
it, had I had more time to do so. The \code{FastM} monad handles the runtime
and with it the global state, whilst \code{FastMethodM} handles the execution
of function calls and the local scope thereof.

As I was out of time, and did not get to instantiate any objects, the
\code{createObject} is incomplete, and does not do what it is supposed to. My
thoughts of implementation thereof is that once allocated, the object should
be pushed onto the state, allowing it to be referenced. After that, since the
return value of the constructor is simply discarded, it would be a mere matter
of running \code{evalMethodBody} on the constructor.

Most of the monadic expression evaluation functions aren't implemented because
I was stalled at the method implementation discussed above. I would guess that
it wouldn't take much time to implement them, once objects could be
instantiated, including the \code{sendMessageTo} method, which also lacks an
implementation.
