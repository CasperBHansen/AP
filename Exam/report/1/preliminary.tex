\subsection{Preliminary}
Before I started implementing any actual part of the parser, I defined some
convenience functions that would aid the implementation of all the following
parts of the parser. These include parsing whitespace, integers, strings,
character- and string tokens, parens, brackets, and building upon these;
things inside parens or brackets, which is a very modular and efficient use of
the library.
