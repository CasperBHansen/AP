\subsection{Assessment}
A simple thing like the convience functions ensures a stable and well-defined
expected behavior across any part of the parser making use of them. Also,
having defined each form of the left-hand side of the grammar as a parser of
its own allows me to reason that the precedence of the parser is correct.

The solution lacks the ability to parse the synonomous expression for sending
messages ({\it Expr '.' Name '(' Args ')'}). Had I had more time I would
probably look to parse it by way of using a chain parser, much like I did with
the arithmetic operation parser. Furthermore, it does not live up to the
grammar specification, because of the problem I had with the receiver method.
