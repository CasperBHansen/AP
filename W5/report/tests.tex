\section{Testing}

\subsection{Starting processes}
In testing \code{start} function, we are expecting the Erlang shell to reply
simply \code{ok}, indicating that nothing went wrong.

\codefig{test-start}{\tests}{5}{12}{Starting up all person processes in the
graph $G$}

Running \code{c(facein), file:eval('tests.erl')} on {\it only} the above
section of the test code we get just that; \code{ok}.

\subsection{Constructing the graph}
Now that we have all person processes running, we can construct the network
graph $G$.

\codefig{test-graph}{\tests}{14}{32}{Construction of the network graph $G$}

We do so by using the \code{facein:add\_friend} API (see section
\ref{api:add_friend}). Yet again, including the code from
\ref{code:test-start} in conjunction with the above, we are expecting to see
just \code{ok} --- and we do.

\subsection{Friend lists}
With a fully constructed network graph $G$, we can now begin testing for some
meaningful output. The test code below queries every person process in the
graph $G$ for their friendlists, respectively, and formats the response using
the built-in \code{io:format} API.

\codefig{test-friendlists}{\tests}{34}{41}{Querying the friendlist of person
processes}

We are expecting to see an output of a person name followed by the person's
friendlist. And this is indeed what we get.
\codefig{friendlist-output}{friendlist.txt}{1}{7}{Output of running the code
from figure \ref{code:test-friendlists}}

\subsection{Broadcasting}
In order to test the broadcasting system we wanted to depict a situation that
allows us to show several different radii. For this, we created a rumour in
graph $G$. The code of figure \ref{code:test-rumour} broadcasts several
messages and at many different radii, such we end up with a very diverse
inbox environment. Instead of verifying each an every message we will
highlight a few representative examples.

\codefig{test-rumour}{\tests}{43}{67}{A rumour spreads throughout graph $G$}

When we print out the resulting inboxes (see figure \ref{code:test-messages})
we see that notibly no one gets Tony's message but himself, as evident of the
output shown below (see \ref{test:broadcast-2} line 77), even though its
radius is very high. This shows that the broadcasting mechanism does indeed
require the message to travel along the directed edges of the graph, as
opposed to the outcry of Ken, which does propagate throughout the entire
graph. Similarly, when Susan {\it whispers} to herself ($R=0$) she does get
her own message.
