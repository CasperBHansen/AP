\section{Test with Hilbert Curves}
We failed in producing a correct Hilbert curve. We did however see parts of it
drawn to some extent, but failed to find the source of the problem. We do know
for a fact that the conversion to screen coordinate system is flawed, but some
of the issues may also stem from our manipulatory library functions.
