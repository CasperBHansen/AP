\subsection{Mapper}
As described, initialization of the mapper threads happens as a consequence of
the coordinator sending out a mapper function (see section \ref{coordinator}).
Upon receiving this function (lines 150--151), we simply restart the loop
substituting the old function with this newly supplied function.

\codefig{mapper}{\assignment}{140}{156}{Mapper loop}

Upon receiving data (line 146), we send the processed data segment to the
reducer on line 147, and then wait for further instructions on line 148.
