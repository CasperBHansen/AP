\subsection{Mapper}
As described, initialization of the mapper threads happens as a consequence of
the coordinator sending out a mapper function (see section \ref{coordinator}).
Upon receiving this function (lines 149--150), we simply restart the loop
substituting the old function with this newly supplied function.

\codefig{mapper}{\assignment}{139}{155}{Mapper loop}

Upon receiving data (line 145), we send the processed data segment to the
reducer on line 146, and then wait for further instructions on line 147.
