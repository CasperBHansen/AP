\subsection{Discussion}
While the preliminary initialization of the reverse index dictionary might
exceed the algorithmic complexity of the \code{grep} method, look-ups using
the reverse indexing method allows us to retreive data in constant time once
this has been built. Conversely, \code{grep} has a linear time complexity at
all times.
