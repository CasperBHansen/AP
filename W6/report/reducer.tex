\subsection{Reducer}
The reducer is responsible for gathering incoming processed data segments from
the mapper threads, and turn all of these into one single result. We do so by
handing the reducer a message (line 115) letting it know it should start
collecting this data, and within it all of the necessary informations to
produce such an output; the reduction function, an initial value and the
number of expected incoming data segments.

Upon receiving this message, we pass control of the reducer thread to the
\code{gather\_data\_from\_mappers} function (see figure \ref{code:gatherer}).
Once all data has been retreived this function call returns allowing the
reducer to wait for further instructions on line 118.
