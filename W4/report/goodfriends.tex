\section{Good Friends}
We say that $X$ and $Y$ are good friends if $X \in F(Y)$ and $Y \in F(X)$,
where $F(Z)$ denotes the friends of $Z$. Our implementation of the
\code{goodfriends} rule {\it extracts} the friends of $X$ and $Y$ on lines
29--30, and then checks that $X$ is in $Y$'s friends, and vice versa.

\code{goodfriends}}

Note that \code{member\_of} replicates the built-in \code{member} rule, and
its implementation can be reviewed in section \ref{appendix:member_of}.
