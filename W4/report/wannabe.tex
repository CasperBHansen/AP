\section{Wannabe}
We say that a person $X$ is a {\it wannabe} iff. $X$ transitively likes
everyone else in the network graph $G$. That is, from the node $X$ we can
reach any other node in the directional graph. Most of the work in this rule
is carried out by the helper rule \code{is\_wannabe} (see appendix
\ref{appendix:is_wannabe}).
