\subsection{Positive tests}

\item[Assignment test:] Lets see if it will do a simple Def.
  \codefig{test0}{../tests.hs}{1}{11}{First test and the program ``headers''.}

\item[Test from assignment:] This test is based of the assignment where a case
  is given for some input and the expected output. The HUnit code for this check
  can be seen in Figure \ref{code:test1}.
  \codefig{test2}{../tests.hs}{9}{12}{A test from the assignment text.}

\item[Simple binding test:] We wanted to test that the precedence of our Curve
  operators were correct, in this case that \texttt{\^} binds stronger than
  \texttt{++}.
