We did not manage to write the overall parser due to time constraint, so we
instead call \texttt{parse} directly from parsec with one of our parsers, and
some input. We will test these independently.

We tried to use HUnit to tests the parser, but ran out of time for finishing it
up. Since our parsers are incomplete, they return a lot fo intermediary types
that HUnit did not have comparison operators for. Thus the tests are all manual,
we hade some fixed strings we used for testing the different parser. A select
few of them can be seen below in Figure \ref{code:exortests} and Figure
\ref{code:curvetests}.

\subsection{Expression tests}

\codefig{exprtests}{../tests.hs}{15}{20}{Our tests for our expression
  parser. Note that the third test is supposed to throw Aan error.}


\subsection{Curves tests}

\codefig{curvetests}{../tests.hs}{22}{27}{Our tests for the curves parser, non
  of them are expected to cause errors.}
