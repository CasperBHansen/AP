\subsection{\texttt{parseString}}
We didn't get the parser to a fully working state, as evident of the section
describing the curve parser. Therefore, there isn't much to tell about our
\code{parseString} function, since it depends on it.

\subsection{\texttt{parseFile}}
\texttt{parseFile} was implemented with the suggestion from the assignment text
and can be seen in Figure \ref{code:parsefile}.
